Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> S
Rule 1     S -> L EQUAL R
Rule 2     S -> R
Rule 3     L -> MULT R
Rule 4     L -> SYMBOL
Rule 5     R -> L

Terminals, with rules where they appear

EQUAL                : 1
MULT                 : 3
SYMBOL               : 4
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

L                    : 1 5
R                    : 1 2 3
S                    : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0
